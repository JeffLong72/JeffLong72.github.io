Purpose: An on-going RPG game thats being developed using Javascript/jQuery ( future development will include PHP and MySQL database ).

To test the game in its current state, 

1) Click the "Turn" drop down list and select "Player 1". A highlighted area will appear on the board to show the locations the Player 1 icon is permitted to move too. Click the button "Move Player" to move the player to your desired location.
 - Optional: Repeat above for Player 2
 
2) Click the button "Move Icons", 
 - each icon will automatically take a turn to move to the location of the closest player within their movement range.
 - where no player is within the icons movement range, the icon will skip its turn ( no action will be taken ).
 - Optional: Click the "Threat" drop down list and choose a Player, all icons will then move towards that player icon instead of the closest player icon.

Note: Tree icons are blocked locations that all icons will navigate around.
